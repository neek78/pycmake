Linker types are case-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and
underscores. Linker types defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake's own
built-in types. The pre-defined linker types are:

``DEFAULT``
  This type corresponds to standard linking, essentially equivalent to
  not specifying :prop_tgt:`LINKER_TYPE` target property.

``SYSTEM``
  Use the standard linker delivered by the platform or the standard toolkit
  (for example, ``SYSTEM`` imply Microsoft linker for all ``MSVC`` compatible
  compilers). This type is supported for the following platforms/compilers:

  * Linux, for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.
  * All Apple variants for ``AppleClang``, ``Clang`` and ``GNU`` compilers.
  * Windows, for ``MSVC``, ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.

``LLD``
  Use the ``LLVM`` linker. This type is supported for the following
  platforms/compilers:

  * Linux, for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.
  * All Apple variants for ``Clang`` and ``AppleClang`` compilers.
  * Windows, for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` compilers with ``GNU`` front-end and
    ``CLang``, ``MSVC`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers with ``MSVC`` front-end.

``BFD``
  Use the ``GNU`` linker.  This type is supported for the following
  platforms/compilers:

  * Linux, for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.
  * Windows, for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` compilers with ``GNU`` front-end.

``GOLD``
  Supported on Linux platform for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.

``MOLD``
  Use the `mold linker <https://github.com/rui314/mold>`_. This type is
  supported on the following platforms:

  * Linux platform for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and ``NVIDIA`` compilers.
  * All Apple variants for ``Clang`` and ``AppleClang`` compilers as an
    alias to ``SOLD``.

``SOLD``
  Use the `sold linker <https://github.com/bluewhalesystems/sold>`_. This type
  is only supported on Apple platforms for ``Clang`` and ``AppleClang``
  compilers.

``APPLE_CLASSIC``
  Use the Apple linker in the classic behavior (i.e. before ``Xcode 15.0``).
  This type is only supported on Apple platforms for ``GNU``, ``Clang`` and
  ``AppleClang`` compilers.

``MSVC``
  Use the Microsoft linker. This type is only supported on Windows
  platform for ``MSVC`` and ``Clang`` compiler with ``MSVC`` front-end.
