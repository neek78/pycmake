CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND
------------------------

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` set this variable to the ``MSBuild.exe``
command installed with the corresponding Visual Studio version.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``MSBuild.exe``
is installed on the computer.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND` and
:variable:`CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM` variables.
