cxx-26
------

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  now implements support for the ``cxx_std_26`` and ``cuda_std_26``
  meta-features to indicate that the compiler mode must be at least C++26.
  These meta-features were first documented by CMake 3.25, but were not fully
  implemented.
