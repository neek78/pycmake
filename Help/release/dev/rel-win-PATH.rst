rel-win-PATH
------------

* The precompiled Windows ``.msi`` installers provided on
  `cmake.org <https://cmake.org/download/>`_, when performing a fresh
  installation, now modify the system-wide ``PATH`` by default.
  When replacing an existing installation, the ``PATH`` modification
  preference is preserved by default.
