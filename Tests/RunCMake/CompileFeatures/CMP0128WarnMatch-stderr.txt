^CMake Deprecation Warning at CMP0128WarnMatch-(C|CXX)\.cmake:[0-9]+ \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0128 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake\.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances\.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD\.

  Policy CMP0128 is not set: Selection of language standard and extension
  flags improved\.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0128" for policy details\.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning\.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, unnecessary flags for
  language standard or compiler extensions may be added.
This warning is for project developers\.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it\.
