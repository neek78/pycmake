CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  The "CXX_MODULE_STD" property on the target "nocxx26target" requires that
  the "__CMAKE::CXX26" target exist, but it was not provided by the
  toolchain.  Reason:

    (Toolchain does not support discovering `import std` support|Experimental `import std` support not enabled when detecting toolchain; it must be set before `CXX` is enabled \(usually a `project\(\)` call\)|Unsupported generator: [^\n]*)


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
