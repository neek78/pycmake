llpkgc
******

This code is generated by the upstream llpkgc repository located at:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/llpkgc

Generally, updates to llpkgc should be made in the upstream utilities library
unless they are exceptionally specific to CMake itself.

The upstream repository does not vendor a generated copy of the parser, so
the associated update script for this dependency runs the generator and
vendors it appropriately. This requires a reasonably up-to-date version of
npm be available in addition to the normal 3rd-party update tooling
requirements.
